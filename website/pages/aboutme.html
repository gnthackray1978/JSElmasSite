<h1>Hello</h1>
<p>I am a Creative Editorial Designer with over seven years of design experience from magazines to books, and from marketing to digital publishing. I develop brand strategies, bookazines and website designs for The Strad magazine, which have increased traffic and revenue.</p>

<p>I have produced designs for a number of international consumer titles and B2B weekly and monthly titles in music, food, lifestyle, business and think tank publications. Elsewhere I rebranded publishing titles and contributed to small and large scale projects including Earth: A Visitors Guide and Grown In Britain with The Penguin Group.</p>

<p>My passion for design ranges widely from lifestyle and the arts. I manipulate typography, photography and illustrations for clear innovative editorial page layouts. Print or digital, I ensure that each design problem I solve maintains brand identity and consistency.</p>
